        This app does not currently have a real email sender, see <a href="https://aka.ms/aspaccountconf">these docs</a> for how to configure a real email sender.
        Normally this would be emailed: <a href="@emailConfirmationLink">Click here to confirm your account.</a>

    <p>Please check your email to confirm your account.</p>
